*Percentages = % of non-missing values in dataset

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
1. CHENGDU HAS MISSING URBANIZATION RATE: 城镇化率_常住人口 is 100% missing
   - Column exists but contains NO DATA
   - Cannot use for direct comparison without computing from other variables

2. CHENGDU HAS MISSING INCOME RATIO: Must compute manually as mu_u / mu_r
   - Chongqing has pre-calculated urban_rural_income_ratio

3. DATA QUALITY DIFFERENCES:
   - Chongqing: Nearly complete data for all core variables (>95%)
   - Chengdu: Significant missingness in mu_u (59.4%) and mu_r (70.6%)
   - Chengdu: 城镇单位在岗职工平均工资 only 31.9% complete

4. CHONGQING TREATMENT ANALYSIS: NEVER-TREATED COUNTIES
================================================================================

Definition of Never-Treated:
  A county is "never-treated" if land_coupon_transaction_binary = 0
  throughout the entire 2009-2020 period

IDENTIFICATION RESULTS:
  Total counties: 37
  Never-treated counties: 6 (16.2%)
  Treated counties: 31 (83.8%)

NEVER-TREATED COUNTIES (6):
  1. 南岸区 (Nan'an District)
  2. 大渡口区 (Dadukou District)
  3. 大足区 (Dazu District)
  4. 江北区 (Jiangbei District)
  5. 沙坪坝区 (Shapingba District)
  6. 长寿区 (Changshou District)

VERIFICATION:
  Both criteria (land_coupon_transaction_binary and after_first_land_coupon_transaction)
  identify the SAME 6 counties as never-treated.

================================================================================
5. BASELINE (2009) CHARACTERISTICS: NEVER-TREATED vs TREATED
================================================================================

COMPARISON OF MEANS:

Urban Income (mu_u):
  Never-treated (n=6):  Mean = 16,440  (Std = 1,265)
  Treated (n=31):       Mean = 13,860  (Std = 2,022)
  Difference:           -2,581 (p < 0.05)
  Interpretation: Never-treated counties are RICHER

Rural Income (mu_r):
  Never-treated (n=6):  Mean = 6,912   (Std = 1,096)
  Treated (n=31):       Mean = 4,703   (Std = 1,156)
  Difference:           -2,210 (p < 0.05)
  Interpretation: Never-treated counties are RICHER

Income Ratio (Urban/Rural):
  Never-treated (n=6):  Mean = 2.408   (Std = 0.226)
  Treated (n=31):       Mean = 3.027   (Std = 0.384)
  Difference:           +0.619 (p < 0.05)
  Interpretation: Treated counties have HIGHER urban-rural inequality

GDP per Capita (gdp_pc):
  Never-treated (n=6):  Mean = 36,761  (Std = 14,798)
  Treated (n=31):       Mean = 18,401  (Std = 10,561)
  Difference:           -18,359 (p < 0.05)
  Interpretation: Never-treated counties are MUCH RICHER (99% higher)

Urbanization Rate:
  Never-treated (n=6):  Mean = 74.23%  (Std = 24.43%)
  Treated (n=31):       Mean = 40.46%  (Std = 17.01%)
  Difference:           -33.77% (p < 0.01)
  Interpretation: Never-treated counties are MUCH MORE URBANIZED

Population (in 10,000 people):
  Never-treated (n=6):  Mean = 66.33   (Std = 26.96)
  Treated (n=31):       Mean = 89.93   (Std = 35.58)
  Difference:           +23.60 (not significant)
  Interpretation: Treated counties are slightly larger

================================================================================
6. CRITICAL INSIGHT: SELECTION BIAS IN CHONGQING
================================================================================

SYSTEMATIC IMBALANCE:
The 6 never-treated counties are systematically different from the 31 treated counties:

Never-Treated Counties are:
  ✓ 18.6% RICHER in urban income
  ✓ 47.0% RICHER in rural income
  ✓ 99.9% RICHER in GDP per capita (36,761 vs 18,401!)
  ✓ 83.4% MORE URBANIZED (74.2% vs 40.5%)
  ✓ Have LOWER urban-rural inequality (2.41 vs 3.03)

INTERPRETATION:
  → Treatment (land coupon adoption) is NOT RANDOM
  → Selection on observables: More developed/urbanized areas did NOT adopt
  → Policy may target less developed areas that need it more
  → Or: developed areas don't need the policy (less rural land pressure)
  → CAUSAL INFERENCE CHALLENGE: Need to account for this pre-treatment imbalance

METHODOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS:
  • Cannot assume treatment is exogenous
  • Difference-in-differences (DiD) assumption: parallel trends may not hold
  • Need to check pre-treatment trends for treated vs control group
  • Consider: propensity score matching, covariate balancing, or other weighting
  • Treated group = typically poorer, more rural areas with greater income inequality

================================================================================
7. CHENGDU: VARIABLE AVAILABILITY & PANEL STRUCTURE
================================================================================

VARIABLE COMPARISON WITH CHONGQING:
✓ Has urban income (mu_u) - partially available (59.4%)
✓ Has rural income (mu_r) - partially available (70.6%)
✗ Missing urbanization_rate - NO DATA (0% complete)
✓ Has GDP per capita (gdp_pc) - fully available (100%)
✓ Has population (total_pop_registered) - mostly available (86.9%)
✓ Has treatment indicators - fully available (100%)
★ MUST COMPUTE: income_ratio = mu_u / mu_r

PANEL STRUCTURE:
✓ PERFECTLY BALANCED: 20 counties × 16 years = 320 observations
  - No unbalanced panel issues
  - Can use standard DiD estimators
  - Ideal for fixed effects estimation

HISTORICAL ADVANTAGE:
✓ Earlier data starts in 2005 (vs Chongqing's 2009)
✓ Covers 16 years (vs Chongqing's 12 years)
✓ Better for identifying pre-treatment trends

DATA QUALITY ISSUES:
✗ mu_u and mu_r have significant missingness (40-30% missing)
✗ Urbanization rate completely missing
✗ Some economic variables have partial missingness
✓ Overall more sparse than Chongqing but good balance

                      Real estate investment (99.1%), village committees (99.5%)
  
  Acceptable (90-100%): Social welfare institutions (90.1%)
  
  Overall: MUCH CLEANER than Chengdu - suitable for econometric analysis

================================================================================
10. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANALYSIS
================================================================================

FOR CHONGQING ANALYSIS:
1. Use 6 never-treated counties as control group
2. Use 31 treated counties as treatment group
3. MUST adjust for pre-treatment imbalance:
   - Create matched samples using propensity score
   - Or: Use weighted DiD with inverse probability weighting
   - Or: Include baseline characteristics as controls in DiD regression
4. Check parallel trends assumption by plotting pre-treatment outcomes
5. Consider that treatment may be "reverse" - policy targets poorer areas
6. Use balanced panel (2009-2020) for clean estimation

FOR CHENGDU ANALYSIS:
1. COMPUTE: income_ratio = mu_u / mu_r
2. Acknowledge: Cannot use urbanization_rate (missing data)
3. Note: Missing data on mu_u and mu_r limits analysis sample
4. Advantage: Longer time period (2005-2020) shows pre-2009 trends
5. Can compare treatment patterns between Chengdu and Chongqing
6. Perfectly balanced panel is ideal for fixed-effects estimation
7. Consider subsetting to years with complete data on all key variables

FOR COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:
1. Different time periods (Chengdu 2005-2020, Chongqing 2009-2020)
2. Different geographic regions but same country context
3. Different treatment incidence: Chengdu and Chongqing vary in adoption
4. Chongqing has clear selection problem; check if same in Chengdu
